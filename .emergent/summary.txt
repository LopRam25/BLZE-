The AI engineer successfully built a comprehensive cannabis e-commerce platform for the BLZE brand, pivoting from a simple landing page to an Uber Eats-like delivery app, and then to a menu-only app with a full Shopify-style admin backend. Key development phases included initial UI/UX implementation, integrating real product images, refining location services with autocomplete, adding age verification and payment options, and finally, creating a robust admin panel for product and inventory management. The AI demonstrated strong debugging skills, particularly in resolving complex backend routing and file upload issues, showing persistence in identifying and rectifying the root causes. The current focus is on debugging an image upload issue where files are uploaded to the server but not correctly saved to the product database in  via the frontend form submission.

<product_requirements>
The user initially requested a premium, high-converting landing page for their cannabis brand BLZE, emphasizing sophisticated visual design, conversion optimization, and an AHA MOMENT experience. The design principles included dramatic color contrast, glass-morphism, subtle shadows, rounded corners, layered design, hover animations, gradients, responsive design, and parallax scrolling. Typography required dramatic scale contrasts and varied weights. The landing page was to include a Hero Section, Features, Social Proof, CTAs, FAQ, and Footer, with a focus on e-commerce components for product showcases and a shopping cart.

Subsequently, the user shifted the vision to an Uber Eats clone for cannabis delivery, implying location-based services and delivery tracking. Specific product listings (Dante's Inferno) were to be showcased with real photos, premium badging, and detailed information. This evolved into a request for a menu-only app with Call Now buttons, supported by a full Shopify-like admin backend for product management (add, edit, delete products, images, price, quantity, COA). Key features included delivery restricted to specific counties (Buncombe, Henderson, Polk, Transylvania), live location/address autocomplete, Stripe payment integration, age verification (21+), and SMS notifications for orders.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Frontend:** React, TailwindCSS, Framer Motion, GSAP, Headless UI, React Router.
-   **Backend:** FastAPI, Python (for data management and file uploads).
-   **Database:** JSON files (, , ) for data persistence.
-   **Infrastructure:** Kubernetes, Supervisor (for process management),  (for initial image selection).
-   **APIs:** Geolocation API, Stripe API, custom REST APIs for product/order management.

<code_architecture>
The application follows a standard React frontend and FastAPI backend architecture.



**Key Files and Changes:**

*   ****:
    *   **Importance**: The main React component, responsible for the overall layout, routing, and integrating various sections/components of the application. It acts as the primary orchestrator for the user interface.
    *   **Changes**: Initially, it built a single landing page. It was then modified to include e-commerce features (product showcase, cart), then pivoted to an Uber Eats-like app, integrating location services, age verification, Stripe payments, and ultimately transformed into a menu-only app with Call Now buttons. More recently, React Router was added to handle client-side routing between the main menu () and the admin dashboard (). It also includes the logic for age verification and rendering different components based on authentication and age status.
*   ****:
    *   **Importance**: Displays individual product information on the customer-facing menu.
    *   **Changes**: Updated to show premium badges, THCA percentages, genetics, and Call Now buttons instead of Add to Cart. Also adjusted to display COA images.
*   ****:
    *   **Importance**: Used in the admin dashboard for adding or editing product details.
    *   **Changes**: Modified to handle multiple image uploads, COA file uploads (initially URLs, then image files), and product-specific details like genetics, grower, aroma, and flavor. Debugging logs were recently added to monitor form state and image handling.
*   ****:
    *   **Importance**: The core UI for the Shopify-like admin panel.
    *   **Changes**: Significant redesign to match the premium frontend UI, including gradient backgrounds, enhanced stats cards, product thumbnails, and COA indicators.
*   ****:
    *   **Importance**: The core FastAPI application defining all backend API endpoints for product management (CRUD), image uploads, COA uploads, and potentially order tracking/statistics. This is the current active backend file.
    *   **Changes**: Created from scratch to support the admin panel features. It handles product data persistence in , image/COA file uploads to , and serves as the API gateway for frontend requests. Debugging was added to address the file upload paths and persistence to .
*   ****:
    *   **Importance**: An older backend file that was mistakenly running via supervisor.
    *   **Changes**: No direct changes by the AI engineer, but its presence caused confusion and required supervisor configuration updates.
*   ****:
    *   **Importance**: JSON file acting as the database for all product information.
    *   **Changes**: Updated to include initial Dante's Inferno product data. The challenge is ensuring uploaded image and COA URLs are correctly saved into this file.

    *   **Changes**: Modified to point the  program to  instead of  to ensure the correct FastAPI application is running.

The application leverages React for a dynamic single-page application experience and TailwindCSS for utility-first styling, ensuring responsive and visually appealing design. FastAPI handles the server-side logic and data persistence using flat JSON files.

<pending_tasks>
-   Implement the backend system for SMS notifications to the specified numbers (8285823092 and 8288441805) based on orders/calls.
-   Address the ongoing issue of uploaded product images not saving to the  database from the frontend form.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
The immediate work being addressed is fixing the issue where images, despite being successfully uploaded to the  directory on the server, are not being saved into the  array within the  entry for the Dantes Inferno" product. This manifests as a "little blue question mark" on the frontend product display, indicating a broken image link because the frontend is trying to load images from an empty array.

The AI engineer has performed several debugging steps:
1.  **Verified image uploads:** Confirmed via `ls -la /app/backend/uploads/` that image files are indeed present on the server after an upload attempt.
2.  **Verified backend API:** Manually tested the `/api/admin/products/{id}` PUT endpoint (e.g., `curl -X PUT ...`) and confirmed it *can* successfully update the `products.json` with image URLs when provided directly.
3.  **Inspected `products.json`:** Confirmed that after a frontend upload attempt, the `images` array for "Dantes Inferno remains empty in .
4.  **Suspected frontend form:** The primary hypothesis is that the frontend  component is not correctly capturing the uploaded image URLs and including them in the  array when submitting the product update request to the backend.
5.  **Added debugging:** The AI engineer has just modified the frontend code (likely  or related components) to include  statements. This is intended to expose what data (specifically the  array) is being prepared by the form for submission to the backend.

The current state is that debugging statements have been added to the frontend to diagnose why the  array is empty when the product update API is called from the frontend. The user has been asked to upload an image and check the browser console for these logs.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
Analyze the browser console output after a new image upload attempt to identify why the  array isn't populated in the frontend form submission.
