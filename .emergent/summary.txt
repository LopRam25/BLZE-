The previous AI engineer successfully initiated a cannabis e-commerce platform for the BLZE brand, evolving it from a landing page to a menu-only app with an admin backend. The trajectory primarily details extensive debugging of an image upload and display issue, followed by comprehensive UI/UX refinements, and finally, the initial implementation of a Content Management System (CMS).

Key debugging efforts involved resolving a persistent image saving problem where uploaded files were not correctly linked in  due to mismatched file paths and an un-synced  instance. This was compounded by a critical static file serving issue, where images were served as HTML instead of actual image MIME types, eventually traced to Kubernetes ingress routing.

Post-image fix, the engineer addressed numerous UI requests: updating the color scheme to black and white, adjusting product pricing to tiers, refining Call Now button aesthetics and placement, fixing image display (cropping vs. containing), and implementing floating Pokémon card styling for product cards. Finally, a significant portion of the work focused on building out a CMS, including backend API endpoints and frontend pages for About Us, Blog, and Contact, integrated with an updated navigation. The conversation concludes with precise UI adjustments based on user feedback, indicating a highly iterative development process.

<product_requirements>
The initial product vision was a premium, high-converting landing page for the BLZE cannabis brand, emphasizing sophisticated visual design, including glass-morphism, gradients, and responsive layouts, with e-commerce components. This evolved into an Uber Eats clone for cannabis delivery, featuring location services, age verification (21+), Stripe payments, and SMS notifications. The scope further refined to a menu-only app with Call Now buttons, supported by a full Shopify-like admin backend for product management (CRUD, images, COA). Delivery was restricted to specific counties.

**Implementation Done So Far:**
The application has been built with a React frontend and FastAPI backend. It features an age verification modal, a product menu displaying Dantes Inferno" with premium badges, THCA percentages, reviews, and a "Call Now" button. A comprehensive admin dashboard allows product management, including multiple image and COA uploads. The backend handles product data in `products.json`, image/COA uploads to `/app/uploads/`, and API interactions. Key fixes include resolving image upload and display issues (correcting `products.json` sync, static file serving via `/api/uploads/`, and frontend state management). UI/UX has been refined to a black and white theme, with updated pricing tiers, consolidated "Call Now" buttons, and a "floating Pokémon card" aesthetic for product cards. Location services have been removed. A CMS for "About Us," "Blog," and "Contact" pages with editable content via the admin panel has been partially implemented, including backend data structures and frontend routing/components.

**Key Files and Changes:**

*   **`/app/frontend/src/App.js`**:
    *   **Importance**: Central React component for routing, overall layout, and integrating features.
    *   **Changes**: Initially contained landing page and then evolved for e-commerce. Significant updates include: React Router setup for `/`, `/admin`, `/about`, `/blog`, `/contact` routes; age verification logic; integration of `Navigation` and new page components; removal of location-based features; extensive UI/CSS class updates for black/white theme, call button styling, product image display (`object-contain`), and pricing grid; implementation of touch swipe for product images.
*   **`/app/frontend/src/components/ProductCard.js` (logic is in `App.js`):**
    *   **Importance**: Displays individual product details on the customer-facing menu.
    *   **Changes**: Updated to display premium badges, THCA, genetics, and "Call Now" buttons. Modified for new pricing tiers (horizontal display), object-fit for full images, and added touch swipe functionality for image navigation.
*   **`/app/frontend/src/Admin.js`**:
    *   **Importance**: Main component for the admin dashboard, including product and CMS management forms.
    *   **Changes**: Redesigned for black/white theme. Modified to handle multiple image/COA uploads and new product details like pricing tiers. Incorporated new tabs for Pages and Blog to manage CMS content.
*   **`/app/backend/main.py`**:
    *   **Importance**: FastAPI backend, defines all API endpoints. This is the active backend.
    *   **Changes**: Created for admin panel. Handles product CRUD and file uploads. Critical fixes for image persistence: ensured consistent `products.json` path (now `Path(__file__).parent / "products.json"`) and correctly served uploaded images via `/api/uploads/{filename}` endpoint. Added new Pydantic models (`Page`, `BlogPost`) and API endpoints for CMS content (`/api/pages`, `/api/blog`).
*   **`/app/backend/products.json`**:
    *   **Importance**: Primary JSON database for product data.
    *   **Changes**: Updated to include initial "Dantes Inferno data, then modified to store new pricing tiers. Subjected to numerous sync/path fixes during image upload debugging.
*   ****:
    *   **Importance**: Directory for uploaded product/COA images.
    *   **Changes**: The backend was initially saving to  instead of , leading to confusion. This was corrected by ensuring the backend reads/writes to , and eventually by serving images through  endpoint rather than static file serving directly to avoid Kubernetes ingress issues.
*   ** & **:
    *   **Importance**: New JSON databases for CMS content.
    *   **Changes**: Newly created to store editable content for the About Us, Blog, and Contact pages.
*   **, , , **:
    *   **Importance**: New components for consistent navigation and displaying CMS content.
    *   **Changes**: Newly created to implement the CMS functionality and site-wide navigation.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was addressing user feedback regarding the floating Call Now button placement and the presence of a Call Now button in the header.

The user explicitly requested:
1.  Move the floating Call Now button from the bottom left to the **bottom RIGHT**.
2.  Ensure there is a Call Now button in the **header**.

The previous actions confirmed the existing setup:
-   A floating Call Now button was successfully added to the bottom left.
-   All Call Now buttons (in header, product card, and floating) were changed to a premium green color, with hover effects and animations.
-   Images were made swipable on touchscreens.
-   Scrolling was locked to vertical only.

The current state is that the code for the floating button is likely still configured for the bottom left. The AI engineer is poised to modify its position as requested by the user.

Relevant snippets from the last few messages:
- **User Request:** I mean in bottom right and add a call now button to the header
- **AI Engineer's immediate response:** Youre absolutely right! Let me move the floating call button to the bottom RIGHT and make sure theres a call now button in the header.

This indicates the precise point of interruption: the floating button repositioning and ensuring the header button's presence (though one was recently added in prior steps).

<optional_next_step>
Move the floating Call Now button to the bottom right of the screen.
