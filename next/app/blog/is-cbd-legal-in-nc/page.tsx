      <h1>Is CBD Legal in North Carolina? (2025 Guide)</h1>
      <p>
        If you’ve Googled <strong>cbd dispensary Asheville NC</strong> or wondered whether it’s
        legal to order hemp flower to your doorstep, you’re not alone. North Carolina’s hemp
        laws can feel complicated, especially with new cannabinoids like THCA and Delta-8 making
        headlines.
      </p>
      <h2>Quick answer</h2>
      <p>
        Yes—hemp-derived CBD products containing less than 0.3&nbsp;% Δ<sup>9</sup>-THC are legal at
        the federal and state level. That means BLZE can deliver premium flower right to your
        home in Asheville and surrounding counties.
      </p>
      <h2>What the 2018 Farm Bill says</h2>
      <p>
        The Farm Bill removed hemp (defined as cannabis with &lt;0.3&nbsp;% Δ9-THC) from the
        Controlled Substances Act. North Carolina adopted these guidelines, allowing in-state
        possession, sale, and <strong>delivery of CBD in Asheville NC</strong>.
      </p>
      <h2>Why choose delivery over a traditional dispensary?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
