      <h2>Asheville NC Dispensaries: What’s Legal?</h2>
      <p>
        Hemp dispensaries in North Carolina may sell products containing less than 0.3 % Δ9-THC.
        That includes flower, gummies, and oils. Traditional shops operate across downtown, but
        parking and limited hours push many customers to online alternatives.
      </p>
      <h2>Why Choose Delivery Over In-Store?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Convenience —</strong> Skip traffic; orders arrive in 60 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Discretion —</strong> No storefront means fewer eyes on your wellness choices.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Fresh inventory —</strong> BLZE updates stock daily, ensuring premium terpene
          profiles.
